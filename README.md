Hi, Iâ€™m @brent-watkins! ðŸ‘‹
I graduated from Arizona State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering.

ðŸ”¥ My main passions in software engineering include web, mobile, and desktop application development, especially working full-stack.
These passions have led me to become experienced with **JavaScript**, **React.js**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Java**, and **Python**, with **Django** as a back-end RESTful API framework.

ðŸŽ¯ One of my personal goals is to learn new skills and improve my current skills each day.
As part of this goal, I am learning **TypeScript**, **Vue.js**, **Node.js**, **React Native**, and **Design Patterns** that enhance the quality and design of applications I am working on.
